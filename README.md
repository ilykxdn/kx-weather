Multi Weather

# Installation
- Download the zip and extract the folder
- If needed, rename the folder from "kx-weather-master" to "kx-weather"
- I highly recommend you put the script inside a [KXscripts] folder if you use multiple of my scripts. If not simply place it in a [standalone] folder.
- Make sure you have ensure [standalone] OR [KXscripts] depending which sub folder you put the script into inside your server.cfg
                                                        Example: ensure [KXscripts]

# QBCore Installation
- Do this after doing the steps above! 
- go to qb-apartments/fxmanifest.lua and change qb-weathersync to kx-weather 
- Then go into qb-apartments/client/main.lua and change all qb-weathersync to kx-weather
- Check qb-apartments/server/main.lua and check if there are qb-weathersync if so change to kx-weather
- Do the same exact thing for qb-houses if you use it.
